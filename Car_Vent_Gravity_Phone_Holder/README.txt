# Summary

This is a completely universal mechanical phone holder which clips into the AC vent. It can be used to hold phones inserted in portrait or landscape and even hold small tablets such as the iPad mini. 

If there are any issues let me know and I'll update the files.

(Excuse the poor quality of my print, the bed was not leveled correctly)

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Creality
Printer: Ender 3
Resolution: 0.2
Infill: 30
Filament_brand: Unknown
Filament_color: Black
Filament_material: PLA

Notes: 
- Make sure to use ABS if you live in a hotter country as PLA deforms at around 60 degrees celsius so it cannot be left in the car.  

- A photo of the print orientations is included above. 

- A higher infill on the arms to make them heavier (up to 100%) and a lower infill on the sled to make it lighter (down to 20%) allows the mount to more easily retain the open position without the use of a rubber band.

## 1. Clean the parts

Remove the support structure and deburr the print bed side of the sliding surfaces, highlighted below.

## 2. Insert the Clip

Push the clip into the small rectangular hole on the back plate as pictured below. This will take quite a bit of force.

## 3. Assemble the parts

First, insert the sled into the backplate and then insert the arms as pictured below. This is easiest done if it is on the edge of a table so the clip can overhang and the parts can lay flat. Then clip the front plate on.

## 4. Add the rubber band (Optional)

This step could take a few attempts to get just right. A rubber band is wrapped around the two posts and through the slot in the sled. The hard part is finding the right rubber band as it needs to be strong enough to open the arms when the phone is removed but not so strong that the arm cannot close around the phone when it is inserted. I did not have the right one so I tied a knot in a larger one and cut off the excess, adding a bit of superglue to make sure it doesn't come undone.
